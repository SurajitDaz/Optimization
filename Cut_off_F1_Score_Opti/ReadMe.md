The aim of this research is to introduce some famous machine learning techniques involving various types of optimizations in order to study if there occurs any significant improvement on the model(s) built up for the classification of cancerous and non-cancerous patient. In order to implement the machine learning model(s) associated with different optimization techniques, WDBC dataset is considered. It is obvious that it can be implemented as a part of Machine Assisted Diagnostic Tool with optimum accuracy. The work has been accepted to be presented in the international conference of DeSe 2022 & to be published in IEEEXplore (Link) and Scopus through DeSe
